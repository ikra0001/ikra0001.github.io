    <h2>Over the Break</h2>
    <p>Over the break I decided to make some money on the side due to the difficulty in finiding employment. I started 3D printing projects at random to people working in construction up to wedding decorations. The experience taught me a lot about client interactions and made me more confident to approach different projects in design as well, So it was a nice educational experience. </p>
